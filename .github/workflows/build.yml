# This workflow will trigger Datadog Synthetic tests within your Datadog organisation
# For more information on running Synthetic tests within your GitHub workflows see: https://docs.datadoghq.com/synthetics/cicd_integrations/github_actions/

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# To get started:

# 1. Add your Datadog API (DD_API_KEY) and Application Key (DD_APP_KEY) as secrets to your GitHub repository. For more information, see: https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/.
# 2. Start using the action within your workflow

  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
